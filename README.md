# Features

- [**Automatic TLS**](https://www.vinceanalytics.com/guides/config/auto-tls/) native support for let's encrypt.
- **Drop in replacement for plausible** you can use existing plausible  scripts and just point them to the vince instance (note that vince is lean and only covers features for a single entity self hosting, so it is not our goal to be feature parity with plausible).
- **Outbounds links tracking**
- **File download tracking**
- **404 page tracking**
- **Custom event tracking**
- **Time period comparison**
- **Public dashboards** allow access to the dashoard to anyone(by default all dashboards are private).
- **Unique shared access** generate unique links to dahboards that can be password protected.
- **Extremely fast** we use bit sliced index of roaring bitmaps.We base our implementation on [serialized roaring bitmaps](https://github.com/dgraph-io/sroar), there is no decoding while reading, data is loaded directly.
- **Zero Dependency**: Ships a single binary with everything in it. No runtime dependency.
- **High events ingestion rate** : We buffer and use LSM based underlying [key value store](https://github.com/dgraph-io/badger) that is optimized for writes.
- **Easy to operate**: One line commandline flags with env variables is all you need.
- **Unlimited sites**: There is no limit on how many sites you can manage.
- **Unlimited events**: scale according to availbale resources.
- **Privacy friendly**: No cookies and fully compliant with GDPR, CCPA and PECR.

# FAQ

## How do I bypass license key?

use `vince crack` command to patch license key, you can choose how long you want 
the cracked key to be valid with `--expires`  flag.

```
NAME:

   vince crack [command [command options]] 

DESCRIPTION:
   Allows users to use vince without a valid license key.
       # vince crack /path/to/vince/data
